# Hangman-CPP
Hangman using C++

This is the code for the Hangman game created by me using C++. 
This was done for a project when I was in school. I used to play this game from my childhood and loved it. So when I got an opportunity to recreate a beautiful game like this by myself, I couldnt hold back. This is one of my first projects and it is close to my heart.

There are multiple files .cpp showing different versions and how I improved the game, step by step.
